HW 3

This program should be working as outlined in the assignment.  To build it
just do: make. To run it just do: ./fdscan -r scan.out -V.  I placed the
ICMP type in the detailed output under the port field.  I chose 6 for the
port scan threshold and 10 for the Host scan threshold.  Reasonable defaults
for these settings would really depend on the network we are trying to detect
scans on and the services that the network provides. I chose 6 and 10 because it 
seemed like a reasonable upper bound of what one might be using for work or school in
a single sitting.  This was built off of HW1 and HW2 so it also uses code from
the tutorial at http://www.tcpdump.org/pcap.html.
