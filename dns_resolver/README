Project 3

build: make
usage: ./myresolver <domain-name> [record-type]  

The objective of this project is to implement a DNS resolver in C. The resolver should query 
the appropriate chain of DNS authoritative servers to resolve a domain name for the requested 
record type, including A records, AAAA records, MX records, TXT records, etc.

There are a number of settings in myresolver.h that limit the program.  We have a maximum
packet size of 4096 bytes.  The maximum rdata size for RRs is 2048 bytes. The maximum
size for domain names and qnames is 256 bytes.  The maximum number of RR records that can
be present in the Answer, Authority and Additional sections is 64.  The program is set up
to send the DNSSEC OPT RR with every request, this can be changed using the GET_RRSIG 
setting. Another setting that may help if you run into any bugs is the PRINT_RESPONSES
setting.  It is currently set to 0, but if changed to 1 it will print the responses for the
Header, Question, Answer, Authority and Additional sections for each iterative query. It
provides output similiar to the HW 6 solution.
