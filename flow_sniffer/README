This program is a flow sniffer that will read a pcap file or capture packets off an
interface to produce flow statistics for packets utilizing TCP, UDP or ICMP protocols.

I developed this by expanding on HW1 and therefore utilized the same web resources.
I used the tutorial at http://www.tcpdump.org/pcap.html to get started.  I 
copied the tutorial code, got it working and then modified it to meet the 
hw requirements.  The Ethernet, IP and TCP structs in the header file were 
all taken directly from this tutorial.  There are a few other lines in the
program that came directly from the tutorial, this is stuff like pcap_open_live()
and pcap_compile() etc.  

The program should run correctly as described in the assignment. I set a default 
time of 60s instead of requiring a -t parameter as I did in HW 1. To build it do:

make

To run it do: 

 ./fsniffer [-r filename] [-i interface] [-t time] [-o time_offset] [-N num] [-S secs]
 ./fsniffer -i eno1 -t 30

When analyzing a file the program will use the time stamps to determine what
to output to the screen.  When sniffing an interface live the program will
use alarm() and a signal handler to determine when to exit.
