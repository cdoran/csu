HW 1

This program sniffs TCP, UDP and ICMP packets from an Ethernet interface or
pcap save file. The program will print the packet header information specified 
in the assignment to the terminal.    

I used the tutorial at http://www.tcpdump.org/pcap.html to get started.  I 
copied the tutorial code, got it working and then modified it to meet the 
hw requirements.  The Ethernet, IP and TCP structs in the header file were 
all taken directly from this tutorial.  There are a few other lines in the
program that came directly from the tutorial, this is stuff like pcap_open_live()
and pcap_compile() etc.  

The program should run correctly as described in the assignment. To run it on
a file do: 

./sniffer -r filename -t time [-o offset ]

or on an interface:

./sniffer -i device -t time  

When analyzing a file the program will use the time stamps to determine what
to output to the screen.  When sniffing an interface live the program will
use alarm() and a signal handler to determine when to exit.
